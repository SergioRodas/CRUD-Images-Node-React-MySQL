** Application that allows you to upload images and save them in a MySQL database. 
Then it fetches and displays them on the frontend using React. 
In the detailed view of the image, the delete function is added. By pressing the button, the image is deleted from the database and the page is reloaded.


It is a practice application for future projects.
Refactoring it by implementing best practices, separating components, hooks, and pages remains pending. Also security, test and finally deployment.
